# ElNinoPrediction
Project for the Data Camp of the Data Science M2 Masters at Ã‰cole Polytechnique

This project's goal was, given a dataset of the history of temperatures in different latitudes and longitudes accross the globe, to predict the El Nino phenomenon.
Feature engineering was highly important to this project, as finding the features that correlate the most with the desired prediction is not a trivial task, and requires some engineering creativity.
